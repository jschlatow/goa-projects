            VNC server connecting to Capture and Event session


This package can be deployed on Sculpt to provide remote desktop functionality.
Simply connect the Capture and Event sessions to the system GUI and add a
forwarding route for TCP port 5900 to your nic_router. The component also
requires a file-system session where it stores its default config as 'vnc.config'
and reads its 'passwd' file.

The VNC server uses the wakeup/stop protocol of the Capture session and sends
a frame update at most every 40ms. You can change the minimum time period between
frames by supplying the 'period_ms' attribute in the config node.

! <config period_ms="20"/>

You can also restrict the area and position that is copied from the Capture
session by setting the attributes 'width', 'height', 'xpos' and 'ypos'.

Password authentication is enabled by setting the 'requires_password' attribute
to 'yes':

! <config period_ms="40" requires_password="yes"/>

If enabled, the plaintext password is read from the 'passwd' file.
