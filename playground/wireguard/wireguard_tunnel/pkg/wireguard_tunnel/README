      Combine wireguard component with NIC router to setup a tunnel

This pkg requires a route to a NIC service for the public interface of
wireguard. It also requires a File_system service where it stores a
wireguard.config and nic_router.config file. In return, it provides a NIC
service that routes to the pkg-internal NIC router which forwards all network
packets to the private interface of wireguard.
