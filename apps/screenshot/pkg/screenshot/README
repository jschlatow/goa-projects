                  Component for taking screenshots

This component connects to a capture session, takes a screenshot and writes
it to a png file on the connected file system.
The screenshot-taking is triggered by the 'trigger' ROM session, which must
contain a single XML node.
The node's name is used a file name (in conjunction with the current time).
Optionally, one can provide a 'width', 'height', 'xpos' and 'ypos' attribute
to constrain the captured area of the screen.

The ready-to-use package comes with an instance global_keys_handler that
updates the 'screenshot' report on key presses of 'KEY_PRINT'. To deploy the
package in Sculpt, connect the Gui and Capture services to the system GUI.
Also add the following line to your nitpicker config:

! <global-key name="KEY_PRINT"     label="runtime -> screenshot -> keys -> input" />
